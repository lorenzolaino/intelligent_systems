# Intelligent Systems Project

The scope of this project concerns the study and the practical application of some machine learning, and in particular deep learning, techniques.

The project mainly focuses on a dataset called "rock_paper_scissors", available on: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/rock_paper_scissors.

The dataset contains 2892 images of hands playing the rock, paper and scissor game.

The experiment is developed using the tools and resources offered by the Python Environment.

The experiment is designed to investigate the behaviours and the capabilities of different Neural Networks under different experimental conditions. 

In particular:
 - The first part of the experiment uses some pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks in order to classify images.
 - The second part shows the steps of the creation from scratch of a CNN.
 
 Finally, the obtained results are compared.
 
 The details of the experiment are reported in the 'Gatto_Laino_Intelligent_System.pdf' file.
